## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**  
  Describe the goal of this Technical Design Document, including how it supports the objectives laid out in the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

- **Scope**  
  Define the boundaries of this document: which subsystems or components of ArtiTech are covered, and what assumptions are made.

- **Audience**  
  List the primary stakeholders (developers, devops, museum staff/IT, etc.) who will benefit from or rely on this technical documentation.

## 2. Architecture Overview

- **High-Level Diagram**  
  Provide a simple diagram illustrating the major components (Front-End, Back-End, Database, ML Models, etc.) and how they interact.

- **Components**  
  - **Front-End**: Kiosk or web interface.  
  - **Back-End**: Python server (Flask/FastAPI/other) handling request routing, AI inference, and database interactions.  
  - **Database**: SQL for metadata + a vector database (FAISS/Milvus/Pinecone) for embeddings.  
  - **Machine Learning Models**: Pretrained CNN/CLIP for similarity, segmentation model, style transfer/inpainting models.

---

## 3. Data Flow & Pipeline

- **Step 1: User Uploads Image**  
  - User can upload a painting for recommendation or a personal photo for insertion.

- **Step 2: Embedding & Similarity Search**  
  - When a user uploads a painting, generate an embedding, query the vector DB, retrieve top-k similar artworks.

- **Step 3: Segmentation**  
  - If the user uploads a personal photo, run the segmentation (background removal) model to isolate the subject.

- **Step 4: Compositing / Style Transfer**  
  - Overlay the segmented user on the chosen painting or apply style transfer/inpainting to blend them in.

- **Step 5: Results & Output**  
  - Return the final composite image or a set of recommended paintings to the front-end for display.

Include a flow diagram if possible, showing how data moves from user input, through the back-end, and back to the front-end.

## 4. Data Model & Database Schema

- **Relational DB (SQL)**  
  - **Tables** (e.g., `paintings`, `artists`, `moods`, etc.)  
    - Example:  
      - `paintings(id, title, artist_id, mood_tags, genre_tags, nuance_tags, image_path, created_at, updated_at)`  
  - **Relationships**  
    - One-to-many between `artists` and `paintings`.  
    - Potential many-to-many for tags (if you store them in separate tables).

- **Vector Database**  
  - **Index Structure**  
    - FAISS Index (Flat, IVF, etc.) or external service (Milvus, Pinecone).  
  - **Embedding Storage**  
    - Embeddings stored as float vectors (e.g., 512 or 2048 dimensions) along with corresponding painting IDs.

- **User Data (Optional)**  
  - If storing user photos or usage logs, define a table (e.g., `user_uploads(id, user_id, image_path, timestamp, etc.)`).  
  - Consider privacy regulations if storing personal images.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**  
  - Python for back-end and machine learning pipelines; potential C++ for high-performance modules if needed.

- **Frameworks**  
  - **Web / API**: Flask, FastAPI, or Django REST.  
  - **ML Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, or alternative.  
  - **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational data; FAISS/Milvus/Pinecone for vectors.  
  - **Front-End**: React/Angular/Vue or kiosk-specific frameworks for touch-based interfaces.

- **Hosting & Deployment**  
  - Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premise servers in a museum environment.  
  - Consider containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) if scaling across multiple instances.

## 6. Model Selection & Configuration

- **Similarity Model (Embeddings)**  
  - Pretrained ResNet, EfficientNet, or CLIP.  
  - Optional fine-tuning on a small dataset of labeled art for improved domain accuracy.

- **Segmentation Model**  
  - U^2-Net, MODNet, or DeepLabV3 for background removal.  
  - Evaluate model performance (accuracy, speed) under typical kiosk scenarios.

- **Style Transfer / Inpainting Model** (Optional)  
  - PyTorch’s Neural Style Transfer, Stable Diffusion Inpainting, or a custom GAN approach.  
  - Outline any prompt engineering or custom training needed.

- **Inference & Optimization**  
  - GPU usage for real-time or near real-time responses.  
  - Use TorchScript or ONNX for faster inference if necessary.  
  - Batch requests if usage is high (e.g., multiple kiosk stations).

## 7. Error Handling & Logging

- **Error Types**  
  - **User Input Errors** (invalid file type, missing image).  
  - **Model Errors** (segmentation failure, embedding calculation error).  
  - **System Errors** (database connection issues, timeouts).

- **Error Handling Strategies**  
  - Return meaningful error messages to the front-end.  
  - Gracefully degrade service if a model is unavailable (e.g., skip style transfer if that service fails).

- **Logging**  
  - Centralized logging (e.g., using Python’s `logging` library or a SaaS logging service).  
  - Log model inference times, request/response status, and error traces.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy

- **Data Transfer**  
  - All image uploads and API requests should use HTTPS/TLS.  

- **Data Storage**  
  - Encrypt user images at rest if storing them (optional, depending on policy).  
  - Comply with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.).  
  - Provide disclaimers in the UI about how user photos are handled.

- **Authentication & Authorization** (If applicable)  
  - If user accounts are needed, use token-based auth or OAuth2.  
  - Restrict admin tools (e.g., uploading new paintings, modifying metadata) to authorized personnel.

---

## 9. Performance & Scalability

- **Performance Targets**  
  - Embedding-based recommendation query: ~1–3 seconds.  
  - Segmentation and basic compositing: ~5 seconds max.  
  - Style transfer (if used): Aiming for no more than ~10–15 seconds for an acceptable user experience.

- **Scalability**  
  - Horizontal scaling of the back-end for multiple kiosk requests.  
  - For large painting databases, consider advanced FAISS indexing (e.g., IVF, HNSW) or external vector DB for faster approximate queries.  
  - Caching frequently accessed paintings or precomputed style transforms if usage patterns repeat.

---

## 10. Deployment & DevOps Strategy

- **Environment Setup**  
  - Use Docker images containing all dependencies (Python, ML libraries, etc.).  
  - Set up separate environments for development, staging, and production.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  - Automated testing on code push (unit tests, integration tests).  
  - Automatic deployment to staging for acceptance testing.  
  - Manual approval step before pushing to production.

- **Monitoring & Alerting**  
  - Track resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory) and response times.  
  - Set up alerts for high error rates or performance degradation.

---

## 11. Testing & QA

- **Unit Tests**  
  - For core functionality (embedding extraction, segmentation function, etc.).  
  - For data access layers (database queries, etc.).

- **Integration Tests**  
  - Test the end-to-end flow: user upload → similarity retrieval → segmentation → compositing.  
  - Ensure modules communicate correctly (DB, vector index, ML models).

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
  - Pilot test with museum visitors or staff to gather feedback on usability, performance, and correctness of recommendations.

- **Performance Testing**  
  - Stress test to see how many simultaneous requests can be handled.  
  - Evaluate GPU usage under load (segmentation + style transfer).
