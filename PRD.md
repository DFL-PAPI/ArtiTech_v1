## 1. Project Overview

**Description**  

ArtiTech is an AI-driven platform that provides two primary functionalities:

1. **Painting Recommendation**  
   When the user uploads their own painting or image, the system suggests visually and thematically similar artworks from a gallery—matching mood, genre, and stylistic nuance.

2. **User Painting Insertion into Paintings**  
   Users can upload a personal painting (or take one on-site). The system removes the background and seamlessly inserts them into the painting. This interactive feature is designed to inspire creativity and spark interest in art, especially for younger audiences.

The aim is to create an engaging tool that allows museum-goers, families, and art enthusiasts to explore and interact with gallery artworks in a novel, interactive way.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Provide Accurate Art Recommendations**  
  ArtiTech should return paintings that share similar mood, genre, or style with the uploaded image.

- **Deliver an Immersive Experience**  
  Let users see themselves “inside” a painting, either via basic overlay or with more advanced style-transfer or inpainting features.

- **Promote Art Appreciation & Engagement**  
  Foster creative exploration and learning among visitors, especially children, by making art more accessible and interactive.

- **Support Scalability**  
  The system should handle various image inputs, a potentially large database of paintings, and simultaneous users (e.g., in a museum or online setting).

## 3. User Personas

### 3.1 Families with Kids

- **Motivation**: Engage children with a fun, hands-on activity that immerses them in art.  
- **Usage Scenario**: On-site museum kiosk or website, needing an easy, intuitive interface.

### 3.2 Art Enthusiasts & Gallery Visitors

- **Motivation**: Discover new paintings based on personal tastes and have a unique, interactive art experience.  
- **Usage Scenario**: Use their own devices (phone, tablet) or a museum kiosk to explore and insert themselves into famous or thematically similar artworks.

### 3.3 Museum/Gallery Staff & Curators

- **Motivation**: Offer innovative, educational experiences that enhance visitor satisfaction and engagement.  
- **Usage Scenario**: Oversee kiosk setup, track analytics on user engagement, maintain or update painting databases.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Painting Recommendation

- **Image Embedding & Similarity**  
  Extract feature embeddings from paintings and user-submitted images using a pretrained CNN or CLIP model. Retrieve top-k results from a vector index for quick similarity search.

- **Mood/Genre/Style Tagging**  
  Each painting has metadata describing its mood (e.g., serene, dramatic), genre (e.g., impressionism, abstract), and stylistic nuances (brushstroke, color palette). The system can re-rank or filter recommendations using these tags.

### 4.2 User painting Insertion

- **Segmentation & Background Removal**  
  Automatically remove backgrounds from user paintings to isolate the person or object of interest.

- **Overlay / Compositing**  
  Place the user’s cutout on the chosen painting. Include positioning (drag-and-drop), scaling, and optional advanced blending.

- **Style Transfer & Inpainting (Optional)**  
  Enhance realism or artistic flair by transferring the painting’s style onto the user or by using AI inpainting to seamlessly integrate the user in the scene.

### 4.3 Interactive Interface

- **Real-Time Preview**  
  Users can see an immediate (or near-immediate) preview of their inserted figure in the painting.

- **Save & Share**  
  Option to download the final composite image or share via email/social media.

---

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Hardware Constraints**  
  The system may require GPU acceleration for real-time segmentation and image retrieval.

- **Rights to Images**  
  The gallery or museum must have the right to display or use the paintings in the database. User images must be handled under data privacy regulations.

- **Connectivity**  
  In a museum environment, ensure stable network or plan for offline capabilities (caching, local processing).

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Recommendation Accuracy**  
  Users rate recommended paintings on relevance. Aim for a high average satisfaction score.

- **User Engagement**  
  Track number of images uploaded, average session duration, or repeated usage.

- **Conversion & Sharing**  
  Percentage of final composite images downloaded or shared on social media.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Image Uploader
- Users must be able to upload or capture images via a camera (kiosk/webcam) or file upload.

### 7.2 Similarity Engine
- Compute and store embeddings for all gallery paintings.  
- For each user-uploaded painting/image, generate an embedding and retrieve top-k similar artworks with minimal latency.

### 7.3 Segmentation
- Implement or integrate a pre-trained model (e.g., U^2-Net, remove.bg API) to isolate the user from the background.

### 7.4 Composite & (Optional) Style Transfer
- Provide a basic overlay system that positions the user onto the painting.  
- Optionally implement advanced style transfer or inpainting for more seamless integration.

### 7.5 User Interface
- Must be simple enough for children to navigate with minimal assistance.  
- Provide a preview of the composite image and let the user move/resize their figure.

### 7.6 Security & Privacy
- Transmit user paintings securely (HTTPS).  
- Clearly communicate if user images are stored or only processed transiently.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**  
  Initial recommendation query should return results in under 3 seconds.  
  Background removal should be completed in under 5 seconds under typical usage.

- **Reliability**  
  Support concurrent users with no system crashes or significant slowdowns.

- **Maintainability**  
  Code should be modular, enabling updates to the model or the user interface without major refactoring.

- **Usability**  
  Interface must be intuitive; minimal text required, with easy-to-follow prompts and large touchscreen-friendly buttons.

- **Scalability**  
  Should handle increasing volumes of paintings and images, as well as additional features (potential expansions to AR or VR).

## 9. User Flows

### 9.1 Flow A: Painting Recommendation
1. User uploads an image of a painting they like.  
2. System computes embedding, performs a similarity search in the gallery database.  
3. System displays top recommended paintings.  
4. User selects a recommended painting to learn more or to use for painting insertion.

### 9.2 Flow B: User painting Insertion
1. User uploads or captures a personal painting.  
2. System removes the background via segmentation.  
3. User selects a painting (from Flow A or from a general list).  
4. System overlays the user’s cutout onto the painting; user can adjust position, scale, etc.  
5. (Optional) User applies style transfer or advanced inpainting.  
6. Final composite image is presented, with the option to save or share.

## 10. Open Questions & Next Steps
- **AR/VR Integration**  
  Will we extend this to an augmented reality experience?

- **Style Transfer Scope**  
  Is an advanced inpainting or neural style approach a “must-have” for initial launch, or a future enhancement?

- **Privacy Compliance**  
  Confirm user consent procedures, storage duration, and disclaimers for user images.

- **Pilot Testing**  
  Plan a pilot in one museum or gallery location to gather real-world user feedback and refine the product.
